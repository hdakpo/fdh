Description: Enumeration algorithms for measuring performance assuming nonconvex
    production technologies. Estimation of Farrell input, output, and
    graph distance functions under different returns to scale assumptions 
    ('vrs' for variable returns to scale, 'crs' for constant returns to scale, 
    'nirs' for nonincreasing returns to scale, and 'ndrs' for nondecreasing
    returns to scale). The package also provides computation of minimum cost, 
    and maximum revenue. The overall efficiency associated to the minimum 
    cost or the maximum revenue is also decomposed into several efficiency 
    components.
