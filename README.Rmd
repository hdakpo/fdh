# fdh: A package for estimating nonconvex frontier models

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

*fdh* provides simple ways, using enumeration algorithms, for estimating 
different Farrell distance function under different returns to scale 
assumptions:

- **Input Technical Efficiency**
  - **Variable Returns to Scale** (vrs)

![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.image?\dpi{110}E_i\left(\mathbf{x}^\circ,&space;\mathbf{y}^\circ\right)=\displaystyle&space;\min_{\mathbf{y}^\circ&space;\leq&space;\mathbf{y}_n}&space;\displaystyle&space;\max_{k=1,\cdots,&space;K}&space;\left\lbrace&space;\frac{x_{kn}}{x_k^\circ}&space;\right\rbrace)

- **Output Technical Efficiency**
- **Graph Technical Efficiency**

Efficiency scores are obtained by imposing different returns to scale 
assumptions:
- **Constant Returns to Scale** (crs)
- **Nondecreasing Returns to Scale** (ndrs)
- **Nonicreasing Returns to Scale** (nirs)
- **Variable Returns to Scale** (vrs)

*fdh* also offers the possiblity of estimating the minimum cost as well as the 
maximum revenue in addition to their corresponding cost efficiency and revenue 
efficiency scores. 

For large datasets, the `parallel` can be used to speed up computations.

## Installation

You can install the development version of fdh from 
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("hdakpo/fdh")
```

## Example

This subsection provides set of examples introducing some important
features of *fdh*.
